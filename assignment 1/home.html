			<h1>Reflection on this assignment</h1>
			<p>I choose &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; for this html page because it includes some HTML5 elements and the browser will know this page is written in HTML5 by this declaration.</p>
			<p>I meet only a few challenges in this assignment since it is not difficult for me and they are all fixed.<br>The first challenge is that I did not include charset specification and later I add by 'charset=windows-1252'. This is not a usual charset but the HTML5 validator recommend it.</p>
			<p>Also, since HTML is suggested not for presentation, I have to delete some 'style' thing in tags and write a CSS file for the page. I have to learn something about selectors and layout in CSS. This is a bit challenging for me. But I finally did it. Bravo!</p>
			<p>Another challenge is the media format in HTML5. I add an audio in this page whose original format is mp3. To my surprise, the default music player did not even show. So I search on the Internet and find that .ogg is supported by Firefox, Chrome and Opera. So I change the format of the audio and it works!</p>
			<p>As to the standards to various stakeholders, here is my reflection. For programmers, sticking to standards enable them to debug and modify more easily. They should keep good programming style and complying with standards is a part of it. For users, web page written in standard show in the same way in all browsers (in recent versions) and whatever browser they use, they enjoy the the same quality and quantity of information. They do not have to change browser when they open a web page, which is annoying. For search engine and some portable devices, web pages written in standard ensure that search engine will get correct part from the page easily and does not miss any useful information, and portable devices will learn and reconstruct the structure of the page correctly and quickly, showing the page in a appropriate way since their screens are limited in size.</p>
			<p>Here is an example of an important standard. For a web page, a appropriate charset should be declared for the brower to show the page correctly. Specially, if a page includes some Chinese or other characters except English letters, a right charset must be declared or these characters may be shown in a confusing way. For programmers, it is inconvenient to check for spelling mistakes(sometimes the consequence is not easily detectable for programmers and users may have to face it) and for users, these characters make no sense to them and they may miss some important information. For search engines, this is the same case. So sticking to standard is really important and charset should always be declared explicitly in case we use some characters other than English letters.</p>
